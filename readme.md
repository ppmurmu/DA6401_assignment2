## 🎯 About the assignment
The goal of this assignment is twofold: (i) train a CNN model from scratch and learn how to tune the hyperparameters and visualize filters (ii) finetune a pre-trained model just as you would do in many real-world applications.

## 🧬 About the dataset
The iNaturalist-12K dataset used in this experiment is a curated subset of the larger iNaturalist collection, consisting of around 12,000 labeled images from 10 biological classes like Mammalia, Plantae, Fungi, and Aves. It presents a fine-grained classification challenge with high intra-class variation and real-world image diversity, making it ideal for evaluating generalization and robustness in CNN models.
